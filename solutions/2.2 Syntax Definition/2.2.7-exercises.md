# 2.2.7 Exercises for Section 2.2

### Exercise 2.2.1:
Consider the context-free grammar:

`S -> S S + | S S * | a`

1. Show how the string `aa+a*` can be generated by this grammar.
2. Construct a parse tree for this string.
3. What language does this grammar generate? Justify your answer.
---
1. `S => S S * => SS+ S * => aS+ S * => aa+ S * => aa+a*`
2.
```
     S
   / | \
  S  S  *
 /|\ \
S S + a
| |
a a
```
3. This grammar produces mathematical postfix notation expressions where
all numbers are `a` and using only * and + (multiplication and
production). In this notation operations +, *, - or / is preceded by 2
expressions that operation is being applied to. In this grammar we see
so it is. Nonterminal `S` stands for expression, terminal `a` stands for
a number, and there are only + and * operations allowed.

### Exercise 2.2.2:
What language is generated by the following grammars? In each case
justify your answer.

1. `S -> 0 S 1 | 0 1`
2. `S -> + S S | - S S | a`
3. `S -> S ( S ) S | ε`
4. `S -> a S b S | b S a S | ε`
5. `S -> a | S + S | S S | S * | ( S )`
---
1. This grammar generates some number of zeroes and the same number of
ones following those zeroes and number of zeroes and ones must be at
least 1. (01, 0011, 000111,...)

2. This grammar produces mathematical prefix notation using only `+`
and `-` and where numbers are replaced by `a`.

3. This one produces correct expressions with braces: "", (), ()(),
(())(), ()(()), ()()(), ((())),..

4. This grammar generates sequences with same quantity of `a` and `b`:
"", ab, ba, abab, aabb,.. Since we cannot get `a` without `b` and
vice versa.

5. This grammar produces regular expressions with alphabet consisting
only from `a`: a, (a), a + a, a a, a *, (aa)*, aa*,.. `a` represents the
symbol, `S + S` - alternation, `S S` - concatenation, `S *` - Kleene
star, `( S )` - brackets.

### Exercise 2.2.3:
Which of the grammars in Exercise 2.2.2 are ambiguous?

The third, fourth and fifth grammars are.\
__3.__ `S -> S ( S ) S | ε`\
```
S -> S ( S ) S -> ε ( ε ) S -> () S ( S ) S -> () ε ( ε ) ε -> ()()
S -> S ( S ) S -> S ( ε ) ε -> S ( S ) S () -> ε ( ε ) ε () -> ()()
```

__4.__ `S -> a S b S | b S a S | ε`
```
S -> a S b S -> a [b S a S] b [a S b S]
  -> a b ε a ε b b ε a ε -> ababab

S -> a S b S -> a [b S a S] b ε -> a b S a S b ε
  -> a b [a S b S] a ε b ε -> a b a ε b ε a ε b ε -> ababab
```

__5.__ `S -> a | S + S | S S | S * | ( S )`
```
S -> S + S -> a + S -> a + S + S -> a + a + a

S -> S + S -> S + a -> S + S + a -> a + a + a
```

### Exercise 2.2.4:
Construct unambiguous context-free grammars for each of
the following languages. In each case show that your grammar is correct.

1. Arithmetic expressions in postfix notation.
2. Left-associative lists of identifiers separated by commas.
3. Right-associative lists of identifiers separated by commas.
4. Arithmetic expressions of integers and identifiers with the four
binary operators +, -, *, /.
5. Add unary plus and minus to the arithmetic operators of 4.

__1.__
```
S -> exp | ε
exp -> exp exp op
op -> + | - | * | /
```

__2.__
```
S -> list | ε
list -> id | list, id
```

__3.__
```
S -> list | ε
list -> id | id, list
```

__4.__
```
expr -> expr + term | expr - term | term
term -> term * factor | term / factor | factor
factor -> val | ( expr )
val -> id | int

id -> id letter | id digit | letter
int -> 0 | natural | (-natural)
natural -> natural digit | nonzero
nonzero -> 1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
digit -> 0|nonzero
```

__5.__
```
expr -> expr + term | expr - term | term
term -> term * factor | term / factor | factor
factor -> val | +val | -val | ( expr )
val -> id | int
```

### Exercise 2.2.5:
a) Show that all binary strings generated by the following grammar have
values divisible by 3. **Hint.** Use induction on the number of nodes in
a parse tree.
```
    num -> 11 | 1001 | num 0 | num num
```

b) Does the grammar generate all binary strings with values
divisible by 3?

__a)__ Proof:\
1. `11` is divisible by 3 because it is 3 in decimal representation.
`1001` is divisible by 3 too because it is 9 in decimal representation.

2. We assume that `num` is divisible by 3.

3. `num 0` and `num num` is also devisible by 3, because `num 0` is
product of `num` and 2 (e.g. 0b11 times 2 = 0b110) and `num num` is
multiplication of `num` by 0b11 which is divisible by 3.

__b)__ No, for example it cannot produce 0, 0b10101 = 21 (`10101`
cannot be produced since the grammar produces only strings containing
two consecutive ones or zeroes).

### Exercise 2.2.6:
Construct a context-free grammar for roman numerals.

```
S -> roman
roman -> thousands hundreds tens ones
thousands -> M thous2 | ε
    thous2 -> M thous1 | ε
    thous1 -> M | ε
hundreds -> simplhun | hunexcept
    simplhun -> D simplhun3 | simplhun3
        simplhun3 -> C simplhun2 | ε
        simplhun2 -> C simplhun1 | ε
        simplhun1 -> C | ε
    hunexcept -> CD | CM
tens -> simplten | tenexcept
    simplten -> L simplten3 | simplten3
        simplten3 -> X simplten2 | ε
        simplten2 -> X simplten1 | ε
        simplten1 -> X | ε
    tenexcept -> XL | XC
ones -> simplone | onexcept
    simplone -> V simplone3 | simplone3
        simplone3 -> I simplone2 | ε
        simplone2 -> I simplone1 | ε
        simplone1 -> I | ε
    onexcept -> IV | IX
```

This grammar represents regular expression
`(M{0,3})(D?C{0,3}|C[DM])(L?X{0,3}|X[LC])(V?I{0,3}|I[VX])`
I found on Wikipedia: [Roman Numerals at Wiki (RU)]
(https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Римские_цифры).

Also we can provide simplified version of this (but it is wrong).
```
S -> roman
roman -> thousands hundreds tens ones
thousands -> M thousands | ε
hundreds -> simplhun | hunexcept
    simplhun -> D simplhun3 | simplhun3
        simplhun3 -> C simplhun3 | ε
    hunexcept -> CD | CM
tens -> simplten | tenexcept
    simplten -> L simplten3 | simplten3
        simplten3 -> X simplten3 | ε
    tenexcept -> XL | XC
ones -> simplone | onexcept
    simplone -> V simplone3 | simplone3
        simplone3 -> I simplone3 | ε
    onexcept -> IV | IX
```
